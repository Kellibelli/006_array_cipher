Grade Checkpoint #1: encoding

1. JOP (no sysos, scanners), use new drop down JOP 
2. executable jar
3. JOP - ask do you want to encode, decode, or crack, or exit ?
-- use a switch case (class example)branch, right now we only have encode
4. For encoding - ask for the plain text msg
5. ask for the key -- another JOP 
6. display the encoded msg - another JOP
7. loop - back to the first drop-down JOP
either go again, or a graceful exit - another JOP



Grade Checkpoint #2: decoding
1. All JOP's, executable jar (no scanner or syso)
2. Select decode, you enter the coded msg
3. Enter the key
4. Program decodes, and JOP's the decoded msg
5. How? When you encode you shift alpha to the right (add key); decode reverses that 
-- shift alpha to the left (subtract key). Easy! Sort of ... problem is the 
-- z-wrap becomes the a-wrap. How's that for an interesting challenge?





Grade Checkpoint #3: cracking (don't know the key)
