Grade Checkpoint #1: encoding

1. JOP (no sysos, scanners)
2. executable jar
3. JOP - ask do you want to encode, decode, or crack, or exit (E/D/C/E)?
-- branch, right now we only have encode
4. For encoding - ask for the plain text msg
5. ask for the key -- another JOP 
6. display the encoded msg - another JOP
7. loop - ask "do you want to encode another msg? (Y/N)" (trap errors)
either go again, or a graceful exit - another JOP



Grade Checkpoint #2: decoding
(NTFS) - use drop-down JOP's here





Grade Checkpoint #3: cracking (don't know the key)
